Simulator 2Β is a sequel that knows exactly where its power lies. It builds on the original\u0027s strengthsβ€”its chill atmosphere, its satisfying feedback, its simple yet addictive loopβ€”and layers in just enough new content and polish to feel fresh. The visuals and performance have seen a clear upgrade, the environments are more creative, and the tools make cleaning more versatile and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nAnd best of all, FuturLab has resisted the industry trend of price hikes. Despite being larger in scale and scope, the game retains the original\u0027s accessible price point, proving that sequels can expand meaningfully without draining your wallet.","DeckVisuals":"4","DeckStability":"3","DeckBattery":"3","Reviews":1825,"SteamId":"2968420"},{"Name":"Quake
