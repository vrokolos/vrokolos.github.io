You're effectively trading fidelity for motion.\n- Changing FPS | Lossless Scaling to 45 | 90 is possible but the power consumption increase is about 17w, which is way too much for portable gaming device, docked not a problem\n- The Arena game mode averaged 12w, whilst Conquest game mode averaged 13w. This review is made with Conquest in mind\n- LSFG has a lot of problems with the brick and cobble\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c486154a-515e-41b3-abf0-07c011bde714)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54103b00-2905-4879-b790-1e77a981453a)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5511a9b5-9669-4bab-9432-6ac4cac6e97b)","performance_rating":"★★☆☆☆ (2/5)","calculated_battery_life_minutes":231},"metadata":{"poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/2437170/library_600x900.jpg","hero":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2437170/library_hero.jpg","banner":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2437170/header.jpg","background":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2437170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg"},"reactions":{"reactions_thumbs_up":0,"reactions_thumbs_down":0},"comments":0,"labels":[{"name":"DEVICE: Valve Steam Deck","color":"FFFFFF","description":"^(Valve )?Steam Deck( OLED| LCD.*)?$"},{"name":"LAUNCHER: Steam","color":"1D76DB","description":"^(Steam)$"}],"user":{"login":"AnteroSpec","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/234164816?v=4","report_count":26},"created_at":"2025-11-15T05:10:56Z","updated_at":"2025-11-15T05:11:15Z"}],"external_reviews":[],"gameName":"SMITE 2","appId":2437170,"projectNumber":202,"metadata":{"poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/2437170/library_600x900.jpg","hero":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2437170/library_hero.jpg","banner":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2437170/header.jpg","background":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2437170/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg"},"reports_summary":"In one submission, SMITE 2 on the Valve Steam Deck OLED felt mixed: it typically ran in the low 30s and required lowered visual settings to keep frame pacing steady. Locking to 30 FPS and using the XESS upscaler at quality was the practical trade for better visuals without blowing the power budget, which stayed around 12–13 W and translated to roughly 3–4 hours of runtime; pushing for higher effective framerates or lossless scaling drove power far higher and is more appropriate for docked play. The report scored performance below average."}
