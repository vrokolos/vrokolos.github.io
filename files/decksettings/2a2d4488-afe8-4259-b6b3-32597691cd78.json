Examples are in the open world of the continent where the camera is zoomed out far, and some of the late game cutscenes. I'm revising my rating to Silver 36 for 36/144hz.\n\n~~My target is 48fps/144hz, although in some areas or if I need to save battery I will reduce to 36fps/144hz which is still quite smooth.~~ Settings are mostly \"Low\", but with Medium Textures and turn off Film Grain.\n\nBy default on Bazzite and CachyOS, the game limits the graphics settings for the Steam Deck build of the game, and looks atrocious. Use the SteamDeck=0 command to enable other graphics settings.\n\nWould also recommend using the Decky-Framegen mod or manually installing Optiscaler to use FSR4. (As a side tangent, one of my nit-picks is that XeSS does very poorly with small particles flying in the wind, like the trash in Cyberpunk2077 or the roses and confetti at the start of Exp33. FSR4 handles these much better). In general for this game, FSR4 even on Performance still looks significantly better than XeSS quality. \n\nLastly, for some easy Quality of Life fixes, download the mod \"Clair Obscur Fix\" and extract to your game folder. Use the launch command \"WINEDLLOVERRIDES=\"dsound=n,b\" %command%\" as mentioned above. It will remove the intro videos and remove 30fps cutscene limit.\nhttps://codeberg.org/Lyall/ClairObscurFix\n\n![Image](https://assets.deckverified.games/uploads/2025-10-13/e964e599-32ec-48d4-bc28-69cd58704dac.jpg)\n\n![Image](https://assets.deckverified.games/uploads/2025-10-13/2e85152e-49bf-4331-b5d3-03095fbca8f1.jpg)\n![Image](https://assets.deckverified.games/uploads/2025-10-13/4d2b8fa0-77cc-4fdc-abc5-0f4e2e99adbe.jpg)\n![Image](https://assets.deckverified.games/uploads/2025-10-13/fc62e45b-90b0-4f28-b6d1-8832f2727d95.jpg)","performance_rating":"★★★★★ (5/5)","calculated_battery_life_minutes":98},"metadata":{"poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1903340/library_600x900.jpg","hero":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903340/library_hero.jpg","banner":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903340/header.jpg","background":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1903340/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg"},"reactions":{"reactions_thumbs_up":0,"reactions_thumbs_down":0},"comments":0,"labels":[{"name":"LAUNCHER: Steam","color":"1D76DB","description":"^(Steam)$"},{"name":"DEVICE: Lenovo Legion Go","color":"FFFFFF","description":"^(Legion Go|Lenovo Legion Go)$"}],"user":{"login":"TheManInBlack-Gaming","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/235621515?u=3c8f5d9bd0a64bcfc6ac5bbdc274e96c8bcb4b40&v=4","report_count":16},"created_at":"2025-10-13T03:00:47Z","updated_at":"2025-11-10T14:17:34Z"},{"id":3182935068,"number":65,"title":"name=\"Clair Obscur: Expedition 33\" appid=\"1903340\" target_framerate=\"<30 FPS\" title=\"30 FPS experience w/ Decky Framegen (Okay visual quality)\"","html_url":"https://github.com/DeckSettings/game-reports-steamos/issues/65","data":{"summary":"30 FPS experience w/ Decky Framegen (Okay visual quality)","game_name":"Clair Obscur: Expedition 33","app_id":1903340,"launcher":"Steam","target_framerate":"<30 FPS","average_battery_power_draw":"15","device":"Steam Deck OLED","os_version":"3.7.8","steam_play_compatibility_tool_used":"Steam Proton","compatibility_tool_version":"default","game_resolution":"Default","custom_launch_options":"~/fgmod/fgmod %COMMAND%","frame_limit":30,"disable_frame_limit":"Off","enable_vrr":"Off","allow_tearing":"On","half_rate_shading":"Off","tdp_limit":null,"manual_gpu_clock":null,"scaling_mode":"Auto","scaling_filter":"Sharp","game_display_settings":"- **DISPLAY MODE:** Borderless Windowed\n- **VSYNC:** Disabled\n- **MAXIMUM FRAME RATE:** Unlimited\n- **SCALING TYPE:** DLSS\n- **SCALING MODE:** Performance","game_graphics_settings":"#### POST PROCESS\n\n- **MOTION BLUR:** Disabled\n\n\n#### RENDERING\n\n- **ANTI-ALIASING:** High\n- **SHADOWS:** Low\n- **GLOBAL ILLUMINATION QUALITY:** Low\n- **POST PROCESS:** Low\n- **TEXTURE:** Medium\n- **VISUAL EFFECTS:** Low\n- **FOLIAGE:** Low\n- **SHADING:** Low","additional_notes":"The default Steam Deck settings provide poor visual quality, but using Decky Framegen allows for FSR 3 upscaling to improve performance.

Runtime mirrors that gap — roughly 1.5–2 hours on the Legion versus about 3–3.5 hours on the Deck — and accepting a 30–36 FPS target with upscaling smooths pacing and saves battery."}
