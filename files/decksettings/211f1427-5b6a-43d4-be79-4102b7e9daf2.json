That setup keeps motion steady and frame timing acceptable, but it does so by cutting visual detail noticeably; the author called the session stable at those settings. No battery numbers were provided, so raise quality at the cost of shorter sessions. Tweaking the upscaler or frame‑generation settings is the main way to shift the balance between visuals and smoothness."}
