In some places you may see 28-30FPS.\nIn the graphics settings, the screen space reflections cost the most. You can select these to on, but expect dips into the low 20FPS in some places.\nFSR looks better than resolution scaling. Without this, expect dips into the low 20FPS in some places.\n\nThe game will display with black borders top and bottom if you don't set full-screen on. I could not figure out why this was the case.\n\nThe UMA buffer size needs to be increased. The default 1GB on the Steam Deck will cause the game to slow to a slideshow in places. I was able to play about 30% of the game with 1GB, but eventually I got to a part in the game where I could not run it for more than a minute before the FPS would drop to single digets and eventually 0 locking everything up. Either 2GB or 4GB seemed to work for me, I ended up sticking with 4GB but I don't know what number is better.","calculated_battery_life_minutes":136},"metadata":{"poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1088850/library_600x900.jpg","hero":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088850/library_hero.jpg","banner":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088850/header.jpg","background":null},"reactions":{"reactions_thumbs_up":0,"reactions_thumbs_down":0},"labels":[{"name":"device:steam-deck","color":"FFFFFF","description":"Steam Deck"},{"name":"launcher:steam","color":"1D76DB","description":"Steam"}],"user":{"login":"Josh5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8370197?u=080571e5c903a9ce5aac4a0938976f24a5604bc6&v=4","report_count":19},"created_at":"2025-05-03T23:26:38Z","updated_at":"2025-05-07T23:59:14Z"}],"external_reviews":[],"gameName":"Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy","appId":1088850,"projectNumber":60,"metadata":{"poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1088850/library_600x900.jpg","hero":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088850/library_hero.jpg","banner":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1088850/header.jpg","background":null}}
