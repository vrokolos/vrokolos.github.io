Otherwise if you overclocked your Steam Deck with 70hz, then you can lock to 35hz and allow for higher battery use through powertools. Overall great game and pretty well optimized.

Community tuning favours a 40 FPS cap alongside a reduced resolution scale (around 75%), which balances visual detail and responsiveness; overclocking can raise frame rates further but at the cost of considerably higher battery use."}
