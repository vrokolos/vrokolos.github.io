The available report rated performance highly and described consistent behaviour with few stability issues, and battery life is strong for a handheld — roughly five hours at about 10 W draw — so sessions last without aggressive power drain. If you need extra headroom, trimming a couple of heavy effects rather than resolution is the common approach."}
