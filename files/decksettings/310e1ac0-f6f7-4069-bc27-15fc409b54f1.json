Power draw sits around 16 W, so battery drains at a steady clip and sessions will likely run a few hours rather than all day. The report ran via Proton and kept a high FPS cap; dropping that cap or easing a couple of effects is the clearest way to tighten frame pacing while keeping the visual fidelity."}
