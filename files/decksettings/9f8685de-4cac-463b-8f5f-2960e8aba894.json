As a turn‑based game these swings are less harmful to play, and the reporter accepted higher visual quality despite the trade‑off. The practical takeaway is that the title is approachable on the device but benefits from trimming a few heavy effects or enforcing an FPS cap to keep frame pacing steadier."}
