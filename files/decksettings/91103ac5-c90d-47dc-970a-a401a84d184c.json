V‑Sync was on and variable refresh wasn’t used, which matched a stable presentation with no visual issues reported. Power draw sat at about 16 W, so expect roughly 2–3 hours per charge under similar conditions, making battery life the main compromise. In short, the game feels smooth with the cap and medium settings, with battery endurance the likely trade‑off."}
