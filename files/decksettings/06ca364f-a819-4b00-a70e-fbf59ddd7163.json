Enabling the upscaler and sticking with the 60 target were the clearest ways to keep performance steady, while some UI pop‑ups felt awkward without a mouse. One stability hiccup—crashing with minimal shared memory—was fixed by increasing UMA to 4G. Power draw sat at about 16 W, suggesting roughly two and a half hours per charge."}
