Visually busy areas experienced minor slowdowns (56-60 FPS), but gameplay remained smooth and wouldn't be noticeable.\n\nThis game report focused on framerate instead of battery life, settings could be further optimized for longer sessions. Some sections of the game has pop-ups that can only be controlled/clicked with a mouse which can feel a bit funky at times.\n\nGame would crash at 1GB UMA, can be resolved by setting UMA to 4G","calculated_battery_life_minutes":188},"metadata":{"poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/3061570/library_600x900.jpg","hero":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3061570/library_hero.jpg","banner":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3061570/header.jpg","background":null},"reactions":{"reactions_thumbs_up":0,"reactions_thumbs_down":0},"labels":[{"name":"device:steam-deck","color":"FFFFFF","description":"Steam Deck"},{"name":"launcher:steam","color":"1D76DB","description":"Steam"}],"user":{"login":"moyogii","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22126651?u=05159789008663f47ede00fdbd6bce6d4b1cd063&v=4","report_count":17},"created_at":"2025-06-28T15:04:44Z","updated_at":"2025-06-28T15:05:02Z"}],"external_reviews":[],"gameName":"Persona5: The Phantom X","appId":3061570,"projectNumber":67,"metadata":{"poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/3061570/library_600x900.jpg","hero":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3061570/library_hero.jpg","banner":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/3061570/header.jpg","background":null}}
