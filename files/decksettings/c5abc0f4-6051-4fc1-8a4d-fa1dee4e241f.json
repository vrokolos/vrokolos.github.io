Download and configure the game compatibility to use the older GE-Proton9-16 and the audio crackling is almost entirely fixed (with the exception of a few very minor points in the game). I tried a few versions, this is the latest version that worked for me. Versions 9-2 to 9-16 seemed fine, then 9-17 has borked audio again.","performance_rating":"★★★☆☆ (3/5)","calculated_battery_life_minutes":120},"metadata":{"poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1888930/library_600x900.jpg","hero":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1888930/library_hero.jpg","banner":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1888930/header.jpg","background":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1888930/page_bg_generated_v6b.jpg"},"reactions":{"reactions_thumbs_up":0,"reactions_thumbs_down":0},"comments":0,"labels":[{"name":"DEVICE: Valve Steam Deck","color":"FFFFFF","description":"^(Valve )?Steam Deck( OLED| LCD.*)?$"},{"name":"LAUNCHER: Steam","color":"1D76DB","description":"^(Steam)$"}],"user":{"login":"Josh5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8370197?u=080571e5c903a9ce5aac4a0938976f24a5604bc6&v=4","report_count":30},"created_at":"2024-12-26T09:23:33Z","updated_at":"2025-10-10T22:20:44Z"},{"id":2777383056,"number":8,"title":"name=\"The Last of Us™ Part I\" appid=\"1888930\" target_framerate=\"30-39 FPS\" title=\"ROG Ally - Prefer Quality\"","html_url":"https://github.com/DeckSettings/game-reports-steamos/issues/8","data":{"summary":"ROG Ally - Prefer Quality","game_name":"The Last of Us™ Part I","app_id":1888930,"launcher":"Steam","target_framerate":"30-39 FPS","average_battery_power_draw":"44","device":"ROG Ally Z1 Extreme","os_version":"CachyOS","steam_play_compatibility_tool_used":"Glorious Eggroll Proton (GE)","compatibility_tool_version":"GE-Proton9-16","game_resolution":"1600x900","custom_launch_options":null,"frame_limit":120,"disable_frame_limit":"On","enable_vrr":"On","allow_tearing":"Off","half_rate_shading":"Off","tdp_limit":null,"manual_gpu_clock":null,"scaling_mode":"Auto","scaling_filter":"Linear","game_display_settings":"- **Display Mode:** BORDERLESS WINDOWED\n- **Display Resolution:** 1600x900\n- **V-Sync:** OFF\n- **Framerate Cap:** 60\n- **Scaling Mode:** AMD FSR 3 Super Resolution\n- **Quality:** Quality\n- **Sharpening:** 35","game_graphics_settings":"#### GEOMETRY SETTINGS\n- **Draw Distance:** LOW\n- **Dynamic Object LOD:** MEDIUM\n- **Character LOD:** MEDIUM\n- **Environment LOD:** MEDIUM\n\n#### TEXTURE SETTINGS\n- **Texture Filtering:** ANISOTROPIC 1X\n- **Texture Sampling Quality:** LOW\n\n#### LIGHTING SETTINGS\n- **Ambient Shadow Quality:** QUARTER RESOLUTION\n- **Directional Shadow Resolution:** MEDIUM\n- **Directional Shadow Distance:** MEDIUM\n- **Image Based Lighting:** OFF\n- **Dynamic Lights Quality:** VERY LOW\n- **Spotlight Shadow Resolution:** MEDIUM\n- **Point Light Shadow Resolution:** MEDIUM\n- **Bounced Lighting:** OFF\n- **Screen Space Shadow Quality:** MEDIUM\n- **Dynamic Screen Space Shadow:** ON\n- **Contact Shadow Quality:** MEDIUM\n- **Screen Space Ambient Occlusion:** ON\n- **Ambient Occlusion Denoise Quality:** LOW\n- **Screen Space Directional Occlusion:** OFF\n- **Screen Space Cone Tracing:** OFF\n\n#### REFLECTIONS SETTINGS\n- **SSR:** ON\n- **SSR Accuracy:** 10\n- **SSR Distance:** 10\n- **SSR Glossy Quality:** 5\n- **RT Reflections:** OFF\n- **RT Cloud Shadow Reflections:** OFF\n\n#### SHARD SETTINGS\n- **Screen Space Sub Surface Scattering:** ON\n- **Refraction Quality:** HALF RESOLUTION\n\n#### POST-EFFECTS SETTINGS\n- **Depth of Field:** CINEMATICS ONLY\n- **Depth of Field Quality:** ULTRA\n- **Motion Blur:** OFF\n- **Bloom Resolution:** HALF RESOLUTION\n\n#### VISUAL EFFECTS SETTINGS\n- **Effects Density:** VERY LOW\n- **Volumetric Effects Quality:** LOW\n- **Lens Flare:** HALF RESOLUTION\n\n#### MISC SETTINGS\n- **Animation Quality:** MEDIUM\n- **Ambient Character Density:** VERY LOW\n- **AI Quality:** LOW","additional_notes":"This will chew through your battery.

Reports called out audio crackling on the Deck with recent Proton builds, and reverting to an older Proton build largely fixed it. An FPS cap around 40 and using an image upscaler were the main ways players steadied performance, and the Ally’s roughly double power draw means much shorter battery sessions compared with the Deck."}
