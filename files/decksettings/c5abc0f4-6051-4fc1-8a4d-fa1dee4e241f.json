Even the latest (at time of writing) GE-Proton9-20 has some major audio issues at various points in the game. Download and configure the game compatibility to use the older GE-Proton9-16 and the audio crackling is almost entirely fixed (with the exception of a few very minor points in the game). I tried a few versions, this is the latest version that worked for me. Versions 9-2 to 9-16 seemed fine, then 9-17 has borked audio again.","calculated_battery_life_minutes":120},"metadata":{"poster":"https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1888930/library_600x900.jpg","hero":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1888930/library_hero.jpg","banner":"https://shared.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1888930/header.jpg","background":null},"reactions":{"reactions_thumbs_up":0,"reactions_thumbs_down":0},"labels":[{"name":"device:steam-deck","color":"FFFFFF","description":"Steam Deck"},{"name":"launcher:steam","color":"1D76DB","description":"Steam"}],"user":{"login":"Josh5","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8370197?u=080571e5c903a9ce5aac4a0938976f24a5604bc6&v=4","report_count":19},"created_at":"2024-12-26T09:23:33Z","updated_at":"2025-01-17T20:54:21Z"},{"id":2777383056,"title":"name=\"The Last of Us™ Part I\" appid=\"1888930\" target_framerate=\"30-39 FPS title=\"ROG Ally - Prefer Quality\"","html_url":"https://github.com/DeckSettings/game-reports-steamos/issues/8","data":{"summary":"ROG Ally - Prefer Quality","game_name":"The Last of Us™ Part I","app_id":1888930,"launcher":"Steam","target_framerate":"30-39 FPS","average_battery_power_draw":"44","device":"ROG Ally Z1 Extreme","os_version":"CachyOS","undervolt_applied":null,"steam_play_compatibility_tool_used":"Glorious Eggroll Proton (GE)","compatibility_tool_version":"GE-Proton9-16","game_resolution":"1600x900","custom_launch_options":null,"frame_limit":120,"disable_frame_limit":"On","enable_vrr":"On","allow_tearing":"Off","half_rate_shading":"Off","tdp_limit":null,"manual_gpu_clock":null,"scaling_mode":"Auto","scaling_filter":"Linear","game_display_settings":"- **Display Mode:** BORDERLESS WINDOWED\n- **Display Resolution:** 1600x900\n- **V-Sync:** OFF\n- **Framerate Cap:** 60\n- **Scaling Mode:** AMD FSR 3 Super Resolution\n- **Quality:** Quality\n- **Sharpening:** 35","game_graphics_settings":"#### GEOMETRY SETTINGS\n- **Draw Distance:** LOW\n- **Dynamic Object LOD:** MEDIUM\n- **Character LOD:** MEDIUM\n- **Environment LOD:** MEDIUM\n\n#### TEXTURE SETTINGS\n- **Texture Filtering:** ANISOTROPIC 1X\n- **Texture Sampling Quality:** LOW\n\n#### LIGHTING SETTINGS\n- **Ambient Shadow Quality:** QUARTER RESOLUTION\n- **Directional Shadow Resolution:** MEDIUM\n- **Directional Shadow Distance:** MEDIUM\n- **Image Based Lighting:** OFF\n- **Dynamic Lights Quality:** VERY LOW\n- **Spotlight Shadow Resolution:** MEDIUM\n- **Point Light Shadow Resolution:** MEDIUM\n- **Bounced Lighting:** OFF\n- **Screen Space Shadow Quality:** MEDIUM\n- **Dynamic Screen Space Shadow:** ON\n- **Contact Shadow Quality:** MEDIUM\n- **Screen Space Ambient Occlusion:** ON\n- **Ambient Occlusion Denoise Quality:** LOW\n- **Screen Space Directional Occlusion:** OFF\n- **Screen Space Cone Tracing:** OFF\n\n#### REFLECTIONS SETTINGS\n- **SSR:** ON\n- **SSR Accuracy:** 10\n- **SSR Distance:** 10\n- **SSR Glossy Quality:** 5\n- **RT Reflections:** OFF\n- **RT Cloud Shadow Reflections:** OFF\n\n#### SHARD SETTINGS\n- **Screen Space Sub Surface Scattering:** ON\n- **Refraction Quality:** HALF RESOLUTION\n\n#### POST-EFFECTS SETTINGS\n- **Depth of Field:** CINEMATICS ONLY\n- **Depth of Field Quality:** ULTRA\n- **Motion Blur:** OFF\n- **Bloom Resolution:** HALF RESOLUTION\n\n#### VISUAL EFFECTS SETTINGS\n- **Effects Density:** VERY LOW\n- **Volumetric Effects Quality:** LOW\n- **Lens Flare:** HALF RESOLUTION\n\n#### MISC SETTINGS\n- **Animation Quality:** MEDIUM\n- **Ambient Character Density:** VERY LOW\n- **AI Quality:** LOW","additional_notes":"This will chew through your battery.
