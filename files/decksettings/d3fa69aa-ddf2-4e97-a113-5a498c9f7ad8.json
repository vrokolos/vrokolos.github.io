Running at the device’s default resolution with the renderer set high but shadow and effect detail trimmed to medium kept frame delivery steady, and V‑Sync was used to help stability. The single community entry rated performance very highly, so players who prioritise snappy controls should favour the higher frame target over cranking every visual option."}
