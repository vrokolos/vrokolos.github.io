Reported power draw was about 15 W, which produced a decent battery runtime in that session. Stability looked good under the balanced preset and performance was rated highly in the submission, so the practical trade-off is clear: keep the cap and medium settings for steady play, or trim a couple of costly effects if you need longer sessions."}
