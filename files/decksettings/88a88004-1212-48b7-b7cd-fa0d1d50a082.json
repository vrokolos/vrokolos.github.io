Testers gave performance good marks, though classic Bethesda instability can still surface for some players. Battery life reflects that gap — roughly six hours on the lower‑draw OLED run versus about four hours on the LCD under the reported settings — so expect smoother motion with a higher cap but shorter sessions as the trade‑off."}
